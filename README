This directory contains the PulseFinder_BlackBox code as developed by Sergey Uvarov at UC Davis for the LUX collaboration.

The pulse finding algorithm is documented in his thesis (work in progress) and full details will be posted when made available.

To use this library in Python, you must first compile the shared object. Assuming a development environment is installed, you will
also need the BOOST libraries as well as the BOOST Python libraries.

http://www.boost.org/users/download/

http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_58_0/libs/python/doc/

These can be easily installed with most package managers for your OS of choice. 

Ensure that you have environment variables pointing to the location of the includes and libs for the following:

BOOST_INC --> Points to folder: /path/to/boost_install/boost/BOOSTVERSION#/include
PYTHON_INC --> Points to folder: /path/to/python_install/PYTHONVERSION#/include/pythonPYTHONVERSION#
BOOST_LIB --> Points to folder containing libboost_python.a
PYTHON_LIB --> Points to folder containing libpython2.7.a

Once you have made the shared object, it can be imported in python and used like so:
